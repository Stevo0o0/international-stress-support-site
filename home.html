    <h2>Understanding Stress &amp; Why International Students</h2>
    <p><strong>What is stress?</strong> Stress is the body's response to perceived challenges or demands that exceed one’s coping resources. It can manifest physically, emotionally, and cognitively, especially when multiple pressures accumulate.</p>
    <p><strong>Why I chose international students:</strong> As someone who came to a new country for education, I experienced cultural adjustment, academic pressure, and isolation. International students often navigate these while far from familiar support networks, making stress particularly pronounced.</p>
    <p><strong>How stress affects me as an international student:</strong> I’ve felt sleep disruption, constant worry about academic performance, and a sense of not belonging, which lowered motivation and increased fatigue. These experiences mirror what many others face.</p>
	  <h3>Top Sources of Stress for International Students</h2>
